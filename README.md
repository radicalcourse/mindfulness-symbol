## Mindfulness symbol ##

In our contemporary world people are addicted to thinking. They are constantly dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. This habit of endless thinking tremendously decreases their quality of life and is the main cause of most of the problems.

> Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when the task is completed, you lay it down. As it is, I would say about 80 to 90 percent of most people’s thinking is not only repetitive and useless, but because of its dysfunctional and often negative nature, much of it is also harmful. Observe your mind and you will find this to be true. It causes a serious leakage of vital energy. 
– Eckhart Tolle

The idea of living in the present moment (mindfulness) is the most fundamental truth. It is widely accepted by philosophers, psychologists and spiritual gurus, but it is not yet present in our mainstream society.

> The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, nor to worry about the future, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly. 
– Buddha

If you do not know what this is all about, then start reading Eckhart Tolle’s “The Power of Now” - a clearly written introduction to mindfulness.

> Although originally articulated as a part of what we know in the West as Buddhism, there is nothing inherently religious about mindfulness, and it is often taught independent of religious or cultural connotation. 
– Jon Kabat-Zinn

**Symbol design**

It took a few years to create this symbol. Hundreds of ideas have been rejected before finally the right solution was found.

![Mindfulness meditation, being here and now, consciousness symbol, reminder, tattoo](https://github.com/radicalcourse/mindfulness-symbol/blob/master/Mindfulness%20symbol/mindfulness-meditation-being-here-and-now-symbol.png?raw=true)

A symbol for the idea of being here and now (also called mindfulness or present moment awareness).

When you see this symbol, anywhere - in public, personal or virtual spaces - it will work as a reminder for you to become aware of this present moment.

![Living in the present moment awareness, zen, buddhist, equanimity symbol, reminder, tattoo. Scientific physical representation of a time. Water drop.](https://github.com/radicalcourse/mindfulness-symbol/blob/master/Mindfulness%20symbol/live-in-the-present-moment-awareness-zen-buddhist-symbol.png?raw=true)

Living in the present moment awareness, zen, buddhist, equanimity symbol, reminder, tattoo. Scientific physical representation of a time. Water drop.

Firstly, this symbol is presented like a physical representation of present moment.

Vertical forms represent time - past and future. Horizontal forms represent space - 360 degrees. And the one is always in the center - being here and now - perfect equanimity.

Secondly, you can see a symbol of a water drop. This is the most often used metaphor to represent the idea of mindfulness. Only this water drop symbol is presented in a kind of mirrored way. But do not think about it, because as mentioned above, this is time - past and future, both are illusions, stay centered in the present.

> Empty your mind, be formless. shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend. 
– Bruce Lee
